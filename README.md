learning framework for perceptual dehazing of high-resolution remote sensing images: Phase 1 (Global Attention Stage): Uses a UFormer-based encoder–decoder with grid patching to capture global atmospheric and ecological context. Phase 2 (Laplacian-Guided GAN Stage): Refines outputs via a dual-branch GAN that operates in both RGB and Laplacian domains, enhancing edges, textures, and perceptual realism.
GLADE-Net achieves state-of-the-art PSNR and LPIPS on SateHaze1k and RICE datasets, balancing structural fidelity and visual quality for environmental and ecological monitoring applications.

## 🧠 Overview

### **Phase 1 — Global Attention Dehazing**
This stage focuses on **coarse haze removal** and global feature restoration using a UFormer-based encoder–decoder optimized for remote sensing imagery.  

**Key Features:**
- 🌍 **Global Attention Encoder–Decoder (UFormer):** Captures large-scale atmospheric and ecological dependencies.  
- ⚡ **PyTorch Lightning Framework:** Streamlined training loop with mixed-precision (FP16) support.  
- 🧩 **Grid-Based Dataset Loader:** Performs on-the-fly tiling, augmentation, and efficient handling of high-resolution inputs.  
- 📈 **Gradual Frequency Loss:** Charbonnier-based loss with PSNR/SSIM evaluation metrics for stable optimization.  
- 🛰️ **Inference Tools:** Enable large-scale aerial image restoration through automated grid merging and tiling scripts.  

---

### **Phase 2 — Laplacian-Guided Perceptual Refinement**
This stage enhances **visual quality and perceptual realism** of the dehazed outputs generated by Phase 1.  
It integrates adversarial learning and frequency-domain guidance for fine detail enhancement.  

**Key Features:**
- 🎨 **Dual-Branch GAN:** Operates jointly in RGB and Laplacian domains to restore both structural and textural details.  
- 🔁 **Laplacian Pyramid Guidance:** Multi-scale refinement of edges and textures using Laplacian-based supervision.  
- 👁️ **Perceptual and Adversarial Losses:** Improve realism and visual fidelity while maintaining quantitative accuracy.  
- 🔬 **High-Resolution Enhancement:** Designed for ecological monitoring and environmental analysis applications.

## 📊 Datasets

| No. | Dataset | Year | Pub. | Number | Image Size | Type | Download |
|:---:|:--------|:----:|:----:|:-------:|:-----------:|:------:|:----------:|
| 01 | [**SateHaze1k**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9093471) | 2017 | WACV | 400×3 | 512×512 | Synthetic | [🔗 Download](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/wtga5ltw5vby5x7trnp0p/Haze1k.zip?rlkey=70s52w3flhtif020nx250jru3&e=1&dl=0) |
| 02 | [**RICE (RICE1 & RICE2)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00600) | 2019 | arXiv | 950 | 512×512 | Synthetic | [🔗 Download](https://github.com/BUPTLdy/RICE_DATASET) |

**Notes:**
- *SateHaze1k* is divided into **Thin**, **Moderate**, and **Thick** subsets simulating different haze densities.  
- *RICE1* and *RICE2* include paired cloudy and clear-sky remote sensing images for evaluating dehazing and cloud removal performance.

## 🧱 Step 1: Grid-Based Dataset Preparation

To generate 128×128 tiles for training and validation:

```bash
python GLADE-Net/tools/grid_crop_pairs.py \
  --root    dataset \ #path to your dataset train[cloud, label], test[cloud, label]
  --out_root dataset_grid \
  --tile_w 128 --tile_h 128 --overlap 0

```
Output tiles will be created under:
dataset_grid/train/
dataset_grid/test/

---

## 🚀 Step 2: Training Phase 1 

Run training from the project root:
```bash
cd GLADE-Net
python -m src.train \
  --train_dir dataset_grid/train \
  --val_dir   dataset_grid/test \
  --img_size 128 --batch_size 1 --epochs 2500 --devices 1 \
  --precision 16 --accumulate 2 --lr 2e-4 \
  --save_ckpt Phase_1.ckpt
```
You can resume training with:

python -m src.train --train_dir ... --val_dir ... --resume /path/to/checkpoint.ckpt

---

## 🔍 Step 3: Inference Phase 1 (Grid UFormer)

Run inference on cloudy test images using the trained checkpoint:
```bash
python GLADE-Net/tools/inference_grid.py \
  --weights Phase_1.ckpt \
  --input   dataset/test/cloud \
  --output  dataset/test/output_phase_1 \
  --tile 512

```

The script will:
- Load each image, pad to a multiple of the tile size.
- Partition into non-overlapping grids.
- Apply the UFormer model patch-by-patch.
- Reconstruct and crop back to the original size.
- Save restored outputs under output_phase_1/.

Example output folders:
dataset/test/cloud/           # input hazy images
dataset/test/label/           # ground truth
dataset/test/output_phase_1/  # Phase 1 restored results

---

## 🧮 Step 4: Training Phase 2 – Perceptual GAN Refinement 

The next phase will use the output from Phase 1 (restored dehazed images) paired with their ground-truth targets to train a perceptual enhancement GAN.  
This stage focuses on:
- Fine texture recovery and color correction.
- Multi-domain learning (RGB + Laplacian).
- Perceptual and adversarial loss integration.

```bash
python GLADE-Net/Phase_2/code/train.py\
     -opt GLADE-Net/Phase_2/code/options/train/train_second_phase.json
```
---
## 🔍 Step 5: Inference Phase 2

Run inference on cloudy test images using the trained weight:
```bash
python GLADE-Net/Phase_2/code/test.py\
     -opt GLADE-Net/Phase_2/code/options/test/test_second_phase.json 
```
